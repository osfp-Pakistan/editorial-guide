=== File extensions

It's is much preferred to use the suggested default file types and extensions:

==== Documents

Text documents that are part of the contribution should be in AsciiDoctor syntax (`.adoc`). This allows us to efficiently manage changes and ensure a corporate identity and style across the published documents. If you need to generate a "hard" version of a specific document version you can link:editorial-guide.html#export-pdf[export it to PDF] using the asciidoctor-pdf tool.

Exported PDFs *must* be placed in the `+_pdfs+`  of the root project. The _gitignore_ file is set up to ignore them everywhere else and will get omit them from commits and branches.

==== Images

Preferred image formats are:

* Portable Network Graphics - PNG (.png)
* Joint Photographic Experts Group - JPEG (.jpg/.jpeg)
* Scalable Vector Graphics - SVG (.png)

[TIP]
====
* PNG is preferred for screenshots
* SVG for exported diagrams
====

Images need to be placed in a  callled `images` in the same directory as the `.adoc` file you wish to use the picture in.

==== Diagrams

If you store Ascii type diagrams in separate files please use their respective type as the file extension, e.g.:

* DITAA: .ditaa
* Mermaid: .mermaid
* PlantUML: .plantuml
* Shaape: .shaape

This makes filtering for this type of files much more convenient. These "extensions" can be used identically to regular file extensions in the include macro.
