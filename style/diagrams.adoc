=== Diagrams

You can include various Ascii art type diagrams (plantUML, ditaa etc.) to your documents. To do so either put them as inline blocks into the document or include a block macro to your page.

NOTE: The block name/macro is determined by the format of the diagram you wish to include. Please refer to the link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-diagram/#creating-a-diagram[list of supported diagram types] to find out what you need to use.

For example to add a ditaa diagram, you add the diagram inline:

[source]
----
[ditaa]
....
                   +-------------+
                   | Asciidoctor |-------+
                   |   diagram   |       |
                   +-------------+       | PNG out
                       ^                 |
                       | ditaa in        |
                       |                 v
 +--------+   +--------+----+    /---------------\

 |     {d}|   |             |    |               |
 +---+----+   +-------------+    \---------------/
     :                                   ^
     |          Lots of work             |

To find out which formats are supported check out the documentation for link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-diagram/[Asciidoctor-diagram].

==== External diagrams

You can also store diagrams in separate files. To include such a file you must include via a macro for example the above diagram stored in a `ditaa.txt`:

----
ditaa::path/to/my.file[My diagram]
----

IMPORTANT: You must use an absolute path from the project root to link to the diagram otherwise Asciibinder will not find it.

=== Advanced features

TIP: There are some link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-diagram/issues/69#issuecomment-89584825[advaced options] for DITAA.

The Ditaa extension supports the options `scale`, `antialias`, `separation`, `round-corners`, `shadows` and `debug`

Options can be specified per block as `<option>=<value>` or globally as a document attribute of the form `:ditaa-option-<option>: <value>`

Block level options override global options

Default values are Ditaa's defaults

The semantics of the options are

[options="heeader"]
|===
|Option|Usage
|`scale`|Scale factor specified as a decimal number (e.g. scale=1.5)
|`antialias`|`true` to enable antialiasing; false to disable it
|`separation`|`true` to leave spacing between adjacent blocks; false to remove it
|`round-corners`|`true` to force round corners everywhere; false to use corner style from diagram
|`shadows`|`true` to enable drop shadows; false to disable them
|`debug`|`true` to display a debug grid in the diagram; false to remove it
