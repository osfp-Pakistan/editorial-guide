== Text formatting

For the "regular" formatting options (bold, italics, monospace etc.) please check out the link:{quickstart}[AsciiDoctor Syntax Quick Reference] since this covers these topics (and others) extensively.

NOTE: This document will explain the style we have decided on to use in the Arago documentation and some less obvious usage patterns and options.

TIP: Many text elements allow for link:http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html#X96[Quoted Text Attributes] for even more powerful formatting options.

== Special text formatting

Our instructions typically contain various special text elements that need to be communicated to the user.

=== Example

----
Please set the Port for ZooKeeper to "2181" in the file `/opt/autopilot/conf/aae.yaml`. Make sure the attribute `Allowed` is set.
----

Please set the Port for ZooKeeper to "2181" in the file `/opt/autopilot/conf/aae.yaml`. Make sure the attribute `Allowed` is set.

== Underline text

If you wish to underline a text you need to use this syntax:

----
This is my [underline]#underlined text#
----

This is my [underline]#underlined text#

== Strike through

To strike through text you need to use this syntax:

----
This instruction is [line-through]#valid for HIRO 5.4# no longer valid.
----

This instruction is [line-through]#valid for HIRO 5.4# no longer valid.

IMPORTANT: Strikethrough is to be avoided as much as possible.

== Special Characters

If you need to add emphasized characters to a description enclose them in curly brackets and the backtick inline syntax.

----
In some cases you must add a backslash (`\`) to escape characters in JSON.
----

In some cases you must add a backslash (`\`) to escape characters in JSON.

TIP: The syntax should be able to handle most special characters. If you need to add a special Ascii character please refer to the link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#replacements[Replacements syntax].

== Warning boxes (Admonition)

The text boxes are called "Admonition" and you can find their syntax described here:

* link:{quickstart}#admon-bl[Quick Reference]
* link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#admonition[AsciiDoctor Manual]

=== Basic Usage

----
NOTE: This is a short note.

[TIP]
====
This is a much longer tip.

It can include line breaks and all kinds of link:google.com[content]

=== Use of Admonition type

The different Admonition types are used to communicate with the user that a passage might be of special interest or contains additional information. Use admonition types only as described below to keep consistent across the content.

[options="header",cols=2]
|===
|Admonition type
|Usage reserved for

|NOTE
|General remarks. As the name suggests "notes" that the user *will want to know and needs to consider*.

|TIP
|Give tipps how the user can *optimize their workflow* and for generally "not quite obvious" tipps and tricks.

|IMPORTANT
|Use this block to point out *details that the user might overlook* that could lead to confusion. Mention important settings, files, procedures etc.

|CAUTION
|Use the Caution label to warn the user that certain steps, if not performed correctly, can lead to a *broken installation/configuration*. This should be reserved for cases that are (easily) *recoverable*.

|WARNING
|If a potential mistake can lead to *data loss or severe damage* to the installation (e.g. removing database tables, directories etc.) warn the user explicitly.
|===

== File names

Use the xref:backticks[backtick] (+`+) inline code syntax.

----
Please add the hostname configuration to `/etc/hosts`.
----

Please add the hostname configuration to `/etc/hosts`.

== Package names

The same applies for package names that are not yet present on the user system or must be downloaded/installed.

(.rpm/.deb/.zip etc.) use the backtick syntax.

----
Please install `your-package-1.4.2.rpm`
----

Please install `your-package-1.4.2.rpm`

== Path names

Use the xref:backticks[backtick] (+`+) inline code syntax.
----
You can find the configuration files in `/opt/autopilot/conf/`.
----

You can find the configuration files in `/opt/autopilot/conf/`.

== Ports

Use the xref:backticks[backtick] (+`+) inline code syntax.
The correct order for a port description is `_PORT/PROTOCOL_` e.g. `_9443/TCP_`.
----
The reverse-proxy/load-balancer is working and can connect to `_9443/TCP_` on both nodes
----

== Factory Names

Use the xref:backticks[backtick] (+`+) inline code syntax.
----
After retrieving all configuration settings, create the `DatatransformerInstance` and inject this into the constructor of the `CBProducerSender`.
----
After retrieving all configuration settings, create the `DatatransformerInstance` and inject this into the constructor of the `CBProducerSender`.

== Class Names

Use the xref:backticks[backtick] (+`+) inline code syntax.

----
To transform you messages into the process specific SDF you should implement your own `de.arago.connectit.base.producer.DataTransformer`
----

To transform you messages into the process specific SDF you should implement your own `de.arago.connectit.base.producer.DataTransformer`

== Function calls

Use the xref:backticks[backtick] (+`+) inline code syntax.

----
The method `processSDF(SDF sdf)` will be invoked every time a message has been received from the connector.
----

The method `processSDF(SDF sdf)` will be invoked every time a message has been received from the connector.

== URLs

We need to distinguish between hyperlinks we want to point to the web or other resources and URL/URi/pURL that we need to show in their raw form.

=== External links

Please use the following format:

----
I want to show you link:https://this-is-my-url.com/[my great website]
----

I want to show you link:https://this-is-my-url.com/[my great website]

NOTE: Add the "link:" macro and closing with the attribute list (even if it's empty) is important to properly render links inside the pages and flowing text.

=== Email links

The link is constructed like `+mailto:address[Text, Subject, Body]+`

----
If you have any questions please write me an mailto:mnapp@arago.co[eMail, Contributor question, Hi I've got a question about hiro-documentation]
----

If you have any questions please write me an mailto:mnapp@arago.co[eMail, Contributor question, Hi I've got a question about hiro-documentation]

=== Raw URLs

There are many occasions where you will want to display a URL in its raw form. Use the xref:backticks[backtick] (+`+) inline code syntax. To avoid automatic URL parsing, add a (`+`) before and after the URL.

----
In your environment you will go to `+https://my-hostname:8888/apps/+`
----

In your environment you will go to `+https://my-hostname:8888/apps/+`

[NOTE]
====
If you do not include the (+++) sign it will generate a broken clickable link:

In your environment you will go to `https://my-hostname:8888/apps/`
====

== Variables/Attributes

=== Variable/Attribute names

Use the xref:backticks[backtick] (+`+) inline code syntax.

=== Variable/Attribute values

Use italics to show values that need to be set.

----
Please set the `Port` to __2181__
----

Please set the `Port` to __2181__

=== Key:Value Pairs

If you want to display complete "Key:Value" pairs please use Italics and the backtick syntax.

----
Please set `__Port:2181__` in `/opt/autopilot/conf/arago.yaml`
----

Please set `__Port:2181__` in `/opt/autopilot/conf/arago.yaml`

=== Defaults

When describing variables or attributes of which a default value is known please include it in the decription where it makes sense.

----
For a proxy setup the `Port` must be __7285__ (Default: __7284__)
----

For a proxy setup the `Port` must be __7285__ (Default: __7284__)

== Images

There are two types of image links.

* Block image
* Inline image

For the correct display of images in exported documents it sometimes is necessary to use block image syntax.

NOTE: For correct scaling of images in PDF documents you need to use block image syntax.

The normal inline image syntax looks like this:

----
image:/path/to/my_image.jpg/.png[width=?,my_image.jpg/.png]
----

Block image syntax simply add an additional colon (`+:+`) to the image macro.

----
image::/path/to/my_image.jpg/.png[width=?,my_image.jpg/.png]
----

IMPORTANT: Asciibinder implicitly looks for images in a directory `images` in the same  as the document. If you include a document in a different location the image must be copied to the images  where it is included.

NOTE: Always use the image filename as the alt text, this will aid in debugging missing images with our external tools.

== Code

Code highlighting is done using the link:http://pygments.org/[pygments library] by default.

TIP: If you require a different hightlighter for your document please check the link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#source-code-blocks[available options]

=== Code blocks

Please describe code blocks as best as you can. If you know the source language please add it to the +[source]+ element.

NOTE: Including actual Asciidoctor source syntax for examples is somewhat tricky so please refer to the {quickstart}[Quick Reference] to see how to properly include source blocks.

TIP: You can add numbered comments to your code by using link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#copy-and-paste-friendly-callouts[Callouts]

[[backticks]]
=== Inline Code

Single lines of code should be enclosed in backticks. This can be used for lines standing alone or within flowing text.

----
To update your system run `yum clean all && yum update`
----

To update your system run `yum clean all && yum update`

== Lists

=== unnumbered / unordered

link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#unordered-lists[Unordered lists]

The correct format is:

----
* First entry
** First sub entry
* Second entry
** Second sub entry
*** Sub-sub entry
* Third entry
----

* First entry
** First sub entry
* Second entry
** Second sub entry
*** Sub-sub entry
* Third entry

=== numbered / ordered

link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#ordered-lists[Ordered lists]

The correct format is:

----
. First entry
. Second entry
.. Second sub entry
. Third entry

A long description that is used to elaborate the third point but breaks the list.

[start=4]
. A fourth entry
----

. First entry
. Second entry
.. Second sub entry
. Third entry

A long description that is used to elaborate the third point but breaks the list.

[start=4]
. A fourth entry

TIP: The numbering and ordering syntax for lists is very powerful. Please refer to the link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#ordered-lists[AsciiDoctor Manual] for advanced options.

== Tables

=== Syntax
There are many syntax variants to create a table in AsciiDoc. This gives users a lot of flexibility but is also confusing. The preferred variant of the syntax is the "one line per cell" syntax.

The basic table syntax is described in the {quickstart}[Quick Reference]

For more elaborate formatting options (cells spanning multiple rows/columns, centered/aligned content etc) please refer to the link:http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html#_tables[Advanced Syntax Options]

=== Titles
Please add a title to your table.

----
.Table of Ports
[cols="2"]
|===
|Port
|Description

|1234
|Used port for protocol x
|===
----

.Table of Ports
[cols="2"]
|===
|Port
|Description

|1234
|Used port for protocol x
|===

=== Headers

----
[options="header",cols="2"]
|===
|First header
|Second header

|Content Row 1 Column 1
|Content Row 1 Column 2

|Content Row 2 Column 1
|Content Row 2 Column 2, content can be longer
and even contain multiple lines
|===
----

[options="header",cols="2"]
|===
|First header
|Second header

|Content Row 1 Column 1
|Content Row 1 Column 2

|Content Row 2 Column 1
|Content Row 2 Column 2, content can be longer
and even contain multiple lines
|===

=== Columns and formatting

The formatting options for rows and columns are very powerful and varied.

Please refer to the tables section of the link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#tables[AsciiDoctor manual]

TIP: A great breakdown of common table formatting use cases can be found in the link:http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html#_tables[Alternate AsciiDoctor manual]
