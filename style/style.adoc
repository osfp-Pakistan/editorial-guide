= Writing style

The documentation is aimed at the reader.

Directly address the reader in your instructions.

* "Click on Save to continue"
* "You must modify the file in <path>"
* "To change the configure port you must edit the configuration file <filename>"

== DONT'S

=== Avoid complexity

Do not overcomplicate sentences. If you need to put three concepts into a sentence split it into multiple sentences. e.g.:

.Bad
----
"You must add the configuration file in <path> and update the settings in <filename> afterwards, restart the machine."
----

.Better
----
"Add the configuration file for the service in <path>. Open <filename> and enter the location of the configuration file you have just added. Restart the service by using <command>."
----

This helps users parse the instructions one-by-one instead of having to filter the correct order out of the long constructed sentece.
