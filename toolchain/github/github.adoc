= GitHub Best Practices

* Merge Strategy
* Reviews
* Labels
** github-labels.adoc
* Squashing
* Cherry Picking

== Commit Messages

Please write your commit messages in the following format:

* "Add new example to javascript element description"
* "Remove obsolete document for license connector"

IMPORTANT: Always include the place you have made changes e.g. "... in component x administration docs" so the customer can actively use the changelog to discover changes you made.

== Files, filetypes and locations

NOTE: Please refrain from adding very large binary files since GitHub is not designed to handle these efficiently. If your file is larger than 5MB please consider a different storage method or contact the project maintainer for advice.

IMPORTANT: All Pull Requests containing files larger than 5MB without sufficient reasoning will be rejected.
